# Quick Python

## Installation

- Download `Anaconda`, which is a Python distribution that comes with a lot of useful packages.

- Install `VS Code`, which is a lightweight IDE that is easy to use.
  - Install the `Python` extension in VS Code.
  - Install the `Jupyter` extension in VS Code. 

### Anaconda

Anaconda installs the `conda` package manager, which is useful to install python packages. In addition, it installs an environment with typical packages like `matplotlib, numpy, pandas` and more. 

### VS Code's most useful command: `Ctrl + Shift + P`

To do anything in VS Code, you can use the command `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette. Then you can type in the command you want to execute. For example, you can type in `Python: Create Terminal` to create a terminal in VS Code.

### Jupyter Notebook

Create a new Jupyter Notebook with the command `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type in `Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook`.


## Python 101

We have three goals:
- Learn basic types: `int, float, str, bool`
- Learn basic control flow: `if, else, for, while`
- Learn basic data structures: `list, tuple, set, dict` 
- Learn basic functions: `def, lambda`

This is roughly section 3 and 4 of [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) which contains in particular quick introduction tutorials in the beginning!
